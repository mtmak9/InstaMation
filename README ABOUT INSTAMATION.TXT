#----------------ABOUT DEVELOPER---------------#
#    Program is created by Michal Makarewicz   #
# Application and script is Licenced Free, you #
# Can Copy,modify and do what you need with it #
# Instagram Bot is Full Invisible until you    #
# prepare your chromedriver, check in google   #
# how to do it. As in ChromeBrowser Driver is  #
# Code where Instagram can see is Selenium use #
#----------------------------------------------#

CONFIGURATION:
----------CHROMEBROWSER---------------------
Program use Chrome version: 84.0.4147.125.
If you will have any problems with Run program, just make sure you have this Ver
of Chrome, reinstal browser with Correct version I Attached instalation file with them in "Chrome Browser" Folder.

----LOGIN DETAILS-----
Your login details is completly Safe is not Stored elsewhere.
Is just use by SELENIUM for type in, on Browser to Login on your Account.

-------HASHTAGS-------
the program requires 5 hashtags to work properly and will ask for them each time it is run.

-------PROGRAM COOLDOWN/STANDBY MODE------
RECOMMENDED: 1800-3600 , if Higher limits than More Safe Mode but Slower Account Growing.

Program need to wait until Run Next Loop/Round, because Instagram Set Limits for ALL users 
on timeFrame by Hours,Day etc..
I create to choose by you How long program have to Wait Until next action.

I tested Limits on Few Accounts and my results was Max Follows/Unfollows/Likes is about 200/H and 500/day
but Always depend by Account Age or Verify. Normally more old account have Higher Limits.

You can test it when limit has appear, or just Stay on Safe Mode.
------------------------------------------
--------LIKES & FOLLOW LIMITS-------------
RECOMMENDED: 5-10 
Same here, Instagram set limits for any actions with Likes,Follow,Comments etc.
The problem is When you Reach this limit to Often, then Instagram can Restrict more limits for your Account.
When I tested script on few Accounts , one of them Get limits and get more often Push Up about Limits and,
I had less Likes/Follow to do on this account. 
So Please be Aware about this and don't Put to high this Limits.
I think best practice to Do for grow account is Set Step by Step Higher this Limits.
When on settings "5", you not reach the Push Up limit, then go to 6 but when you will get Push Up Limits then go Lower.
This make Sense Correct?
-------------------------------------------
---------------UNFOLLOW LIMIT--------------
RECOMMENDED: 50-200 [BUT NOT HIGHER THAN 200]
I have tested and best limit was 100, but also here , there is Daily limit for this action, and is really hard to
find exactly limit what your account have, so Keep this in Mind.
But in this situation is Different than in Like&Follows, because when you Reach UNFOLLOW Limit, is Nothing Happen to
Your Account, you just Get back your "UNFOLLOWERS", when you Reach Limit. But Dont get any Notification or any limits
on your account. So this is Great. But Just check what limit you can setup because Set correct limit for this action, as 
Better is When Bot do Less action than More as instagram Follow ALL account reaction and if is TOO MUCH Action or too Automatic 
then You propably can get Suspension for too many action but Even when you get Suspension, you can always Appeal and Just Let them know, it 
was you because you Boring or Something...
Instagram have many Safety systems, and Algorith and they are not in 100% Sure in this Actions.
--------------------------------------------
----------CHROMETASKKILL--------------------
Bot, every time is Start Runing is use ChromeDriver but when stop working Program don't Kill Process, So if you will Run program too often then your Ram memory can Stock.
Then just Run this File "ChromeTaskKill" and this program will Kill ALL Chrome Driver 
Working in background and it will Fresh your Ram memory from this tasks.

---------------SAFETY:----------------------
This Bot Immitate completly 100% of behavior Humans. Is Safe until Instagram don't change them Algorith.
Then Bot will need Update - Let me know Then I will fix it :)
